**General pattern**

Each meeting, **we will begin at 9 to allow for childcare, commuting, and other arrangements**. You are welcome to arrive at 8.30 as per the official schedule, but I will not begin until 9. Consequently, I will also not be stopping for the remainder of the scheduled time. Feel free to bring croissants, coffee, toast, etc. Scrambled eggs are to be avoided as they are messy.

Each week, a designated person will take us through their engagement with a particular Programming Historian tutorial, as indicated below. There will be readings to support this engagement; I will discuss these individually with you once we divy up the work. Some will highlight uses of the approach, or perhaps issues with the approach, or could've usefully been improved by the approach... or... or... or. I will expect you to also clearly articulate connections in other research you've done, read, or courses you're taking/have taken (this alone is an important habit to cultivate.) You can also bring digital history projects in the wild into the discussion.

(**nb** Even if it's not your week to present, it will be a richer experience if you've given the tutorial a shot as well.)

The remaining time will run along the lines of a mini unconference. That is, I expect you to have a sense before class of things you want to work on/discuss/collaborate on. As [thatcamp.org](https://thatcamp.org) says:

> at an unconference, the program isn’t set beforehand: it’s created on the first day with the help of all the participants rather than beforehand by a program committee. Second, at an unconference, there are no presentations — all participants in an unconference are expected to talk and work with fellow participants in every session. An unconference is to a conference what a seminar is to a lecture; going to an unconference is like being a member of an improv troupe whereas going to a conference is (mostly) like being a member of an audience.

I've had far too many seminars that felt like dreadful dreadful conferences. So, let's give this a try. One thing that I think I would like you to discuss every session: how does this particular tutorial move us closer to the final project goal? What could we do with this? How can we open this thing up even mmore?

These sessions will be opportunities for the more techy to help the less, for the more theoretically inclined to help the more methodologically inclined. I will say this though:

> doing embodies theories of knowing and how you do things reveals what you know. So know what you're doing.

The sequence of lessons we will go through mirrors the progression of a digital history research project - setting up your environment/project/workflow; data capture; data munging; analysis; visualizations; public consumption.

**Meeting 1** 

> Getting started. How to use Google Colab as your own digital history lab. How to load sample notebooks into Colab. Thoughts on Reproducibility and Replicability. Discussion of this class syllabus. Discussion and agreement as a class on how we will use AI tools.

+ Exploration of Github and setting up your open notebook repository.
+ Come to the first class having read Eryk Salvaggio's [_Underutilized._](https://cyberneticforests.substack.com/p/underutilized) and [_The Hypothetical Image_](https://cyberneticforests.substack.com/p/no-mourning-for-synthetic-ruins).**
