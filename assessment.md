# I'm looking for engagement, critical reflection, and experimentation.

Push yourself!

## Active engagement
Don't just take it in, be active in the class discussion. Leadership and positive contributions to the class discussion, wherever that takes place. Each session will involve hacking, poking, prodding, and otherwise doing digital history. We can spend time every session considering how all of this will play to the final project as well.

## Open Notebooks
9 meeting entries (you are encouraged to make a repository in github just for these), plus 1 session where you lead the group through your experience with a paricular Programming Historian tutorial (these will be assigned). Your posts should/could reflect on the readings, the discussion, and what you learned from the session leader's experience that week. You should also be frequently posting regarding your final project as it develops. If you are working on a Programming Historian tutorial, make a particular note about any hidden 'gotchas' you encounter. Video notes/walk throughs are encouraged. You can post these on youtube, vimeo, or similar.  You will select your nine best entries for me to grade. YOU WILL WRITE THESE DURING APPROPRIATE CLASS TIME. Bullet points etc are appropriate. These are like 'lab notebooks' that help you document your experiments and understanding. They are not great works of literature.

## Project 
The major project in this class will be to explore the issues of digital history as discussed in this course, evidenced through the creation of a playful engagement with the tutorials of the Programming Historian. This can be an individual effort, or a collaborative effort. Other options are possible in consulation with me. Check out [Epoiesen](https://epoiesen.carleton.ca) for inspiration.

> You will create digital history through a playful engagement with teaching digital history.

## Reflective Short Unessay
This [unessay](https://people.uleth.ca/~daniel.odonnell/teaching/the-unessay) reflects on the issues of digital history as experienced by the student in the course of completing the major project. The length and format need only be 'appropriate' and 'compelling'. It can be built into a 'paradata' section to accompany your game. This unessay may be highly personal, and does not necessarily need to be 'written' in a text-forward dead-tree format. The grading of the project and the reflective essay will follow the unessay conventions. We will talk about this.

It would be a good idea to bring your laptop or device to each session. Remember, you don't need to be 'techy', whatever that means. You just have to be willing to give it a go and to be open and frank about what happened next. And you know what else?

# You do not have to work in isolation

Digital history can be very frustrating. You don't have to work in isolation. You may collaborate; you can google for solutions (but for the love of god DO NOT accept any ai-generated 'answer'); you can ask for advice whereever seems appropriate. Make sure, when you do get frustrated (and you will), to just walk away from the computer. There is more than one way to do things digital, and when you're frustrated you won't find any of them. Shut it down, go for a walk, have a coffee. Come back when you're fresh.

But do acknowledge in your work any collaboration or help you have received. Failure to acknowledge help received will be regarded like a failure to cite.

# But what about AI?

'AI' is mostly a marketing term. But there may be cases where it is appropriate to use things like LLM (large language models) or other such tools in the context of doing digital history. **However**: 
	+ you **may NOT** use such tools for your open notebooks. Even a whiff of generated text will be grounds for rejection of the work. Be prepared to defend orally anything you write/create.
	+ you **MAY** use such tools in the following circumstances:
		+ for understanding what code does
		+ for making alterations to example code for a particular use
		+ for expanding code to do new things. 

# Grading
