_Why? Because it's there!_

Also: because it's a great visual metaphor for learning digital history. I'm nothing if not subtle.

# Introduction

_most recent update: May 23 2024_

Magdalen College Cambridge holds [the archive of the explore George Mallory](https://magdalene.maxarchiveservices.co.uk/index.php/mallory-george-herbert-leigh). We are going to work with this body of materials to learn various tools and techniques of digital history. 

I am starting a project on the archaeology of Mount Everest, and so I am using this course to not only give you an opportunity to work with a bounded, interesting, corpus of historical documents but also to kick start my application process to SSHRC. I will be workshopping some of my application materials with you.

There are a variety of flavours of digital history; I tend to categorize them by the eventual aims of the investigator. 
+ There is a digital history meant as preservation and access: aspects of digitization, data management, metadata. 
+ There is a digital history meant as public story telling
+ There is a digital history as history influenced by quantification and analytics.

These are just a few lenses through which we may view digital history. My goals are several:
+ for you to identify which lense interests you most
+ develop foundational abilities for pursuing those interests
+ develop a professional online persona with on a space that you control

I expect you to [fail gloriously](https://thedigitalpress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/failing_gloriously_final.pdf), which is to say: digital work is frustrating and things often don't work the way you want them to. To 'fail gloriously' is to be open about what has not worked so that your colleagues can learn from your experience.

**Stuff isn't going to work**. It's just the way it is. Digital approaches are replete with tacit assumptions and things-left-unsaid. There are generational aspects at play, too. Those of us who came of age in different eras of digital tech - the home computer boom of the '80s, the early web of the '90s, etc etc - were exposed to different ways of thinking about what computers/digital techs were _for_ and how best to use them. This **will** mean that I will make assumptions about your starting profeciences which may or may not be warranted.

I expect you to call me on this. After all, how else can we learn?

Therefore, we will begin with this corpus of material of this Edwardian man, this product of Empire, this veteran of WWI, this colonial explorer. We will develop our skills through digital manipulation of his papers and letters (some of which were found on his body in 1999 when it was discovered on Mt. Everest.)

## How class meetings will work

In general, each week one of you will take us through your exploration of the materials. You will have chosen a particular [Programming Historian tutorial](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/) from the list below and completed it. Then, you will have tried to adapt it to the Mallory archive. Your goal will be to explain to us the information left tacit in the tutorial. Tells us where you got stuck. Tell us how you solved the problem. Tell us how what you learned sheds new light on Mallory and his world. Tell us how what you learned might be useful for your own research (whether for your eventual thesis/MRE or in other classes). You will reflect on how this tutorial intersects with your other courses, your own research, and indeed, the few readings that I will provide you (I expect you to follow through links to bibliography and so on in the Programming Historian tutorials and to bring those to bear in the conversation). If you are not leading the post-mortem, I still expect you to be familiar with the tutorial, the associated links and so on so that we can have a productive conversation.

# Assessment

**Active engagement** in the class discussion. Leadership and positive contributions to the class discussion, wherever that takes place. Each session will involve hacking, poking, prodding, and otherwise doing digital history. We can spend time every session considering how all of this will play to the final project as well.

**Open Notebooks**. 9 meeting entries (you are encouraged to make a repository in github just for these), plus 1 session where you lead the group through your experience with a paricular Programming Historian tutorial (these will be assigned). Your posts should/could reflect on the readings, the discussion, and what you learned from the session leader's experience that week. You should also be frequently posting regarding your final project as it develops. If you are working on a Programming Historian tutorial, make a particular note about any hidden 'gotchas' you encounter. Video notes/walk throughs are encouraged. You can post these on youtube, vimeo, or similar.  You will select your nine best entries for me to grade. YOU WILL WRITE THESE DURING APPROPRIATE CLASS TIME. Bullet points etc are appropriate. These are like 'lab notebooks' that help you document your experiments and understanding. They are not great works of literature.

**Project**: the technologies of video games are an extremely powerful - and perhaps the natural?- form for digital work. The major project in this class will be to explore the issues of digital history as discussed in this course, evidenced through the creation of a playful engagement with the tutorials of the Programming Historian. This can be an individual effort, or a collaborative effort. Other options are possible in consulation with me.

> You will create digital history through a playful engagement with teaching digital history.

**Reflective Short Unessay**. This [unessay](https://people.uleth.ca/~daniel.odonnell/teaching/the-unessay) reflects on the issues of digital history as experienced by the student in the course of completing the major project. The length and format need only be 'appropriate' and 'compelling'. It can be built into a 'paradata' section to accompany your game. This unessay may be highly personal, and does not necessarily need to be 'written' in a text-forward dead-tree format. The grading of the project and the reflective essay will follow the unessay conventions. We will talk about this.

It would be a good idea to bring your laptop or device to each session. Remember, you don't need to be 'techy', whatever that means. You just have to be willing to give it a go and to be open and frank about what happened next. And you know what else?

**You do not have to work in isolation**

Digital history can be very frustrating. You don't have to work in isolation. You may collaborate; you can google for solutions (but for the love of god DO NOT accept any ai-generated 'answer'); you can ask for advice whereever seems appropriate. Make sure, when you do get frustrated (and you will), to just walk away from the computer. There is more than one way to do things digital, and when you're frustrated you won't find any of them. Shut it down, go for a walk, have a coffee. Come back when you're fresh.

But do acknowledge in your work any collaboration or help you have received. Failure to acknowledge help received will be regarded like a failure to cite.

**But what about AI?**

'AI' is mostly a marketing term. But there may be cases where it is appropriate to use things like LLM (large language models) or other such tools in the context of doing digital history. **However**: 
	+ you **may NOT** use such tools for your open notebooks. Even a whiff of generated text will be grounds for rejection of the work. Be prepared to defend orally anything you write/create.
	+ you **MAY** use such tools in the following circumstances:
		+ for understanding what code does
		+ for making alterations to example code for a particular use
		+ for expanding code to do new things. 

**Grading:**

Class Participation: 10% + 10% for your session that you lead.

Open notebook entries: 30%

Contribution to Final Project: 30%

Final reflection: 20%

# Schedule

**General pattern**

Each meeting, **we will begin at 9 to allow for childcare, commuting, and other arrangements**. You are welcome to arrive at 8.30 as per the official schedule, but I will not begin until 9. Consequently, I will also not be stopping for the remainder of the scheduled time. Feel free to bring croissants, coffee, toast, etc. Scrambled eggs are to be avoided as they are messy.

Each week, a designated person will take us through their engagement with a particular Programming Historian tutorial, as indicated below. There will be readings to support this engagement; I will discuss these individually with you once we divy up the work. Some will highlight uses of the approach, or perhaps issues with the approach, or could've usefully been improved by the approach... or... or... or. I will expect you to also clearly articulate connections in other research you've done, read, or courses you're taking/have taken (this alone is an important habit to cultivate.) You can also bring digital history projects in the wild into the discussion.

(**nb** Even if it's not your week to present, it will be a richer experience if you've given the tutorial a shot as well.)

The remaining time will run along the lines of a mini unconference. That is, I expect you to have a sense before class of things you want to work on/discuss/collaborate on. As [thatcamp.org](https://thatcamp.org) says:

> at an unconference, the program isn’t set beforehand: it’s created on the first day with the help of all the participants rather than beforehand by a program committee. Second, at an unconference, there are no presentations — all participants in an unconference are expected to talk and work with fellow participants in every session. An unconference is to a conference what a seminar is to a lecture; going to an unconference is like being a member of an improv troupe whereas going to a conference is (mostly) like being a member of an audience.

I've had far too many seminars that felt like dreadful dreadful conferences. So, let's give this a try. One thing that I think I would like you to discuss every session: how does this particular tutorial move us closer to the final project goal? What could we do with this? How can we open this thing up even mmore?

These sessions will be opportunities for the more techy to help the less, for the more theoretically inclined to help the more methodologically inclined. I will say this though:

> doing embodies theories of knowing and how you do things reveals what you know. So know what you're doing.

The sequence of lessons we will go through mirrors the progression of a digital history research project - setting up your environment/project/workflow; data capture; data munging; analysis; visualizations; public consumption.

**Meeting 1** 

> Getting started. How to use Google Colab as your own digital history lab. How to load sample notebooks into Colab. Thoughts on Reproducibility and Replicability. Discussion of this class syllabus. Discussion and agreement as a class on how we will use AI tools.

+ Exploration of Github and setting up your open notebook repository.
+ Come to the first class having read Eryk Salvaggio's [_Underutilized._](https://cyberneticforests.substack.com/p/underutilized) and [_The Hypothetical Image_](https://cyberneticforests.substack.com/p/no-mourning-for-synthetic-ruins).**


# Colophon

I've taught varieties of this course over the years. The most recent version was fully online, asynchronous, and exhausting. I wrote _several_ support documents for that course. You might find those documents useful, if slightly out-of-date. I repeat - I have not updated those docs for broken links or changing approaches. Nevertheless, they might help round out your understanding, so I encourage you to use them in tandem with the Programming Historian. You can start [here](https://graddh.netlify.app/docs/tutorials/github-basic/) but **nb anything else on that site like eg assessment, schedule etc is from 2021!**
